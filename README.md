Resurrecting old code, for the glory of mankind.

## The Goal
To make a public repository of software that otherwise would be sealed in a vault somewhere and forgotten forever. 

Ideally, I'd like to get source code access to long-forgotten operating systems, but the scope of this should be broader.
A non-exhaustive list includes:
- compilers and interpreters
- userland utilities
- filesystem software
- process control software
- network stacks or drivers (or whatever they might be called in the relevant OS jargon)
- firmware
- relevant non-Western OSes or code

In addition to this, I'd like to try and work out where the rights to certain long-dead operating systems currently lie, and if we can, contact said rights holders and see if they have the source, and would consider releasing it.

Persoonally, I dream of getting CMost or NOS/VE, but we'll see.

This is a work in progress, so check back.
